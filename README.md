This python macro uses modules/libs such as: pywin32 and pynput

install handle sysinternaltools first

extract the handle.zip  in the same directory as where you extracted main.zip

make sure to run handle.exe first and accept it's terms and conditions then run a roblox game 

run main.exe as admin wait for it to ask you to run the autoclicker before being able to run more games

+ Made the click function better by saving the last mouse position and moving the mouse there after the program is done clicking.
